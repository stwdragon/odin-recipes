    <h2>Delicious Bowl of fresh Guacamole</h2>
    <p>This guacamole recipe is very easy and 
        quick to make while also being very delicious 
        and healthy. With only a few ingredients and about 
        10 minutes you can make a dip that is better than what 
        you will find at most restaurants. The spice level can 
        be adjusted for your preferences, but I think it's much 
        better with 
        the fresh crunch of fresh jalapeno peppers. Enjoy!</p>
